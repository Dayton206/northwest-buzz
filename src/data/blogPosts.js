            <p className="mb-6">Every contractor knows the pain. You buy a lead for $50. You call them instantly. They don't pick up. You call again. They tell you they've already hired someone else who called 30 seconds before you.</p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">This is the <strong className="text-white">Shared Lead Trap</strong>. You are competing on speed and price, not on value and expertise.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Maths of Organic Leads</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">When a customer finds you through a YouTube video where you demonstrate your expertise, they aren't looking for "a contractor". They are looking for <strong className="text-brand-blue">YOU</strong>.</p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-brand-light/80">
                <li>They have already seen your face.</li>
                <li>They know how you work.</li>
                <li>They trust your judgement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-6">These aren't leads. They are pre-sold prospects. And they close at 40-50%, compared to the 5-10% of cold shared leads.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">Mike, a residential electrician in Seattle, was skeptical. "Who wants to watch me wire a panel?" he asked.</p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">Turns out? <strong className="text-white">140,000 people.</strong></p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The "Boring" Content Strategy</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">We filmed one of his standard panel upgrades. We didn't add crazy effects. We just focused on clean audio and clear explanations of <em>why</em> he was doing what he was doing.</p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">The video took off. Homeowners loved the transparency. Other electricians watched to learn.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Results</h2>
            <div className="bg-brand-blue/10 p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-brand-blue mb-8">
                <p className="text-lg font-bold text-white">Month 12 metrics:</p>
                <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1 text-brand-light">
                    <li>YouTube Ad Revenue: $1,200/mo</li>
                    <li>Amazon Affiliate (Tool links): $850/mo</li>
                    <li>Sponsorships: $1,000/mo</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Passive: ~$3,050/mo</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>And the best part? He got 12 high-end panel upgrade jobs directly from people who saw that specific video.</p>

            <p className="mb-6">Most contractor websites look the same. "Free Estimates." "Licensed & Bonded." "20 Years Experience."</p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">That's the baseline. That doesn't differentiate you.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">1. The "Clean Site" Guarantee</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">Homeowners are terrified of a mess. Show them video proof of your drop cloths, your shoe covers, and your end-of-day cleanup process. It relieves anxiety instantly.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">2. Pricing Transparency</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">You don't have to give exact quotes, but explaining <em>what drives the price</em> in a video builds massive trust. "Why does this cost $5k vs $2k?" Answer that, and you win the job.</p>

             <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">3. The Face Behind the Phone</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">People buy from people. A simple video introducing yourself and your team makes you a human, not a faceless company.</p>

                <li>Answer specific customer questions ("How often should I change my furnace filter?")</li>
